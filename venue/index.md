### Finding the venue

The Frescati campus is Stockholm University's main campus, located just north of central Stockholm. It is easy to access through multiple forms of public transport; the journey from Stockholm Central Station by subway or from Stockholm Odenplan by bus takes 10--15 minutes.

Språkstudion's facilities are located on the ground floor (floor 2) of Södra huset, building E, in the southern part of Frescati. 

A map and detailed directions can be found [**on Språkstudion's website**](https://www.su.se/sprakstudion-language-learning-resource-centre/about-spr%C3%A5kstudion?open-collapse-boxes=ccbd-findus#findus).
