title: Remote participation
---

In the spirit of ETT 2021, this ETT conference aims to provide PhD students with an opportunity to share their work and receive feedback from colleagues internationally. As opportunities to do so are often inaccessible to many PhD students because of prohibitively expensive travel costs and environmental concerns, the Organizing Committee for ETT 2024 is committed to making remote participation possible throughout the entire conference, for both presenters and non-presenting participants. 

## Logistics

All conference sessions will be streamed live through Zoom. To follow the sessions, either download the Zoom application or open the conference Zoom links in a web browser. Access to the Zoom sessions will require a password, which will be sent by email to registered participants before the start of the conference.

Remote presenters are asked to install Zoom prior to the conference, and ensure that microphone and screen sharing settings are configured properly. There will be opportunities to test sound and screen sharing setups during the conference, and sufficient time will be provided for changeovers between presenters during sessions.

**Please note:** As the conference venue is in Stockholm, Sweden, sessions will be scheduled during daytime in Central European Summer Time (CEST/UTC+2). If you will be presenting from a different time zone and would like to avoid your talk being scheduled at nighttime, please [**contact the organizers**](/contact) and we will attempt to accommodate this if possible.

## Registration

Conference registration is free for both online and on-site participants. To register, please see the [**conference registration**](/register) page.
